\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document introduces a set of new ITK classes intended to interface the ITK
Image IO infrastructure with different image databases. In particular, the
classes described here take particular care of enabling users to extract
sub-pieces of images from the databases, and in that way empower them to deal
with very large images (Gigabytes to Terabytes).

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

Large images are becoming ubiquitus in many research fields. They are
particularly common in microscopy, remote sensing and computer vision.  Image
sizes are growing at a higher rate than the size of computer memory and
therefore there is a great interest in software method that allow to process
images by partitioning in pieces that can temporarily be fit into memory. For
images beyond the 10 Gigabyte range, it is not even practical to think about
copying them through the network (LUIS: add here the timing of copying 2Gb
through a home network and an office network).
